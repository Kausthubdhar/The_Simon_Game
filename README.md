# The_Simon_Game
--> The game starts with the screen lighting up one or more tiles in a specific sequence.   
--> The player must then repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding tiles in the same order.  
--> As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more complex.   
--> The objective is to see how far the player can go without making a mistake.  
--> Hope you like the game!! It's done with simple HTML - CSS - JavaScript  
--> This project was made as a part of my learnings from Web Development.  
--> Thanks for visiting my repository!! and have a great day.
